> i am learning rust. i need a basic project that shows rust fundamentals 
and best practices, like a build script, a library dependency, a simple 
function with a unit test, and a main application that calls the simple 
function. i don't know any of this stuff. create a plan for this simple repo
 to teach me the basics. don't write code, just a single markdown file with 
the plan. 

⏺ I'll create a plan for a basic Rust project that will teach you the
  fundamentals. Let me write a markdown file with a comprehensive learning
  plan.

     # Rust Learning Project Plan
     ## Project Overview
     A simple temperature converter application that demonstrates Rust
     fundamentals and best practices.
     ## What You'll Learn
     ### 1. Project Structure
     - Standard Rust project layout with `src/` directory
     - `Cargo.toml` - Rust's package manifest (like `package.json` in
     Node.js)
     … +155 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I've created a comprehensive learning plan in LEARNING_PLAN.md that
  outlines a temperature converter project. This project will teach you:

  - Project structure with Cargo.toml, library code, and main application
  - Core Rust concepts like functions, types, ownership, and error handling

  - Unit testing with the built-in test framework
  - Build scripts that run before compilation
  - External dependencies using the clap crate for CLI parsing
  - Essential cargo commands you'll use daily

  The plan walks through each component, explains what you'll learn, and
  provides a suggested learning path. It's a practical, real-world example
  that demonstrates Rust best practices while staying simple enough to
  understand quickly.

  When you're ready, I can implement this project for you step-by-step!

> let's add to the plan: i'm going to use claude code heavily while working 
on this project. so claude code needs to be able to compile the code and get
 compiler output to fix problems, needs to run unit tests and get test 
output to fix things, etc.

       159 +  ## Working with Claude Code
       160 +  
       161 +  Since you'll be using Claude Code to build this project, 
           + here's how Claude Code will help you:
       162 +  
       163 +  ### Iterative Development Workflow
       164 +  
       165 +  1. **Write Code**
       166 +     - Claude Code will create the initial files based on 
           + Rust best practices
       167 +     - Code will be written incrementally, one component at a
           +  time
       168 +  
       169 +  2. **Compile and Get Feedback**
       170 +     - After writing code, Claude Code will run `cargo build`
           +  or `cargo check`
       171 +     - Rust compiler errors will be captured and analyzed
       172 +     - Claude Code will explain what the errors mean in 
           + beginner-friendly terms
       173 +     - Code will be fixed based on compiler feedback
       174 +  
       175 +  3. **Run Tests**
       176 +     - After library code is written, Claude Code will run 
           + `cargo test`
       177 +     - Test output will be analyzed (passes, failures, 
           + panics)
       178 +     - If tests fail, Claude Code will debug and fix the 
           + issues
       179 +     - You'll see the test-driven development cycle in action
       180 +  
       181 +  4. **Run the Application**
       182 +     - Once tests pass, Claude Code will run `cargo run` with
           +  various arguments
       183 +     - Runtime errors will be caught and fixed
       184 +     - You'll see the complete working application
       185 +  
       186 +  5. **Code Quality Tools**
       187 +     - Claude Code will run `cargo clippy` to catch common 
           + mistakes
       188 +     - Will run `cargo fmt` to format code to Rust standards
       189 +     - You'll learn Rust idioms through these suggestions
       190 +  
       191 +  ### What Makes This Ideal for Learning with Claude Code
       192 +  
       193 +  - **Fast Feedback Loop**: You'll see compile → error → fix 
           + → success cycles
       194 +  - **Learn from Mistakes**: Rust's compiler errors are 
           + educational, and Claude Code will explain them
       195 +  - **Best Practices**: Claude Code will demonstrate 
           + idiomatic Rust from the start
       196 +  - **Incremental Building**: Each component is built and 
           + tested before moving to the next
       197 +  - **Real Development**: You'll experience the actual Rust 
           + development workflow
       198 +  
       199 +  ### Example Workflow You'll See
       200 +  
       201 +  ```
       202 +  1. Claude Code writes src/lib.rs with conversion functions
       203 +  2. Runs: cargo build
       204 +  3. Compiler error: "missing lifetime specifier" (example)
       205 +  4. Claude Code explains the error and fixes it
       206 +  5. Runs: cargo build again - SUCCESS!
       207 +  6. Runs: cargo test
       208 +  7. Test output shows which tests pass/fail
       209 +  8. If failures, Claude Code debugs and fixes
       210 +  9. Runs: cargo test again - ALL PASS!
       211 +  10. Moves to next component (main.rs)
       212 +  ```
       213 +  
       214 +  ### Commands Claude Code Will Use
       215 +  
       216 +  - `cargo check` - Fast compilation check without building 
           + binary
       217 +  - `cargo build` - Full compilation to catch all errors
       218 +  - `cargo test` - Run unit tests and show results
       219 +  - `cargo test --verbose` - Detailed test output
       220 +  - `cargo run -- <args>` - Run the application with 
           + arguments
       221 +  - `cargo clippy` - Linting for common issues
       222 +  - `cargo fmt` - Format code to standard style
       223 +  
       224 +  This iterative approach means you'll learn by seeing real 
           + errors and their fixes, not just working code.
       225 +

⏺ Perfect! I've updated the learning plan with a new section called "Working
   with Claude Code" that explains:

  The iterative development workflow you'll experience:
  - Write code → Compile → Fix errors → Test → Fix failures → Run
  application

  What makes this ideal for learning with Claude Code:
  - Fast feedback loops with compiler errors
  - Explanations of Rust's notoriously helpful (but complex) error messages
  - See the test-driven development process in action
  - Learn from actual mistakes and fixes, not just perfect code

  Example workflow showing the compile-fix-test cycle you'll see repeatedly

  Specific cargo commands Claude Code will use to build, test, lint, and
  format your code

  This approach means you'll learn Rust the way professional Rust developers
   actually work - by iterating based on compiler feedback, running tests
  frequently, and using Rust's excellent tooling ecosystem. The Rust
  compiler is famously helpful with its error messages, and Claude Code will
   help translate those into beginner-friendly explanations.
